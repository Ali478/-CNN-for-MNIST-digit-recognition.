# -CNN-for-MNIST-digit-recognition.
Please have a look at the attached Python/Pytorch script for training a CNN for MNIST digit recognition.  You are encouraged to try it on Colab and see how well it works. It might be a good idea to analyze the miss classified digits.  The data iterators and preprocessing used by this script seems interesting as well.
